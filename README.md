# Comfy UI API Proxy

## Overview
This project provides a proxy layer between client applications and the Comfy UI API. It simplifies client interactions by handling input data processing, managing image URLs, tracking the progress of data processing, and retrieving processed images in base64 encoding.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Automatically processes incoming data to ensure compatibility with the Comfy UI API.
- **Image URL Handling**: Manages URLs for images that are processed through the API, ensuring they are correctly formatted and securely transmitted.
- **Progress Tracking**: Offers real-time updates on the status of data processing, allowing clients to monitor progress and manage workflows efficiently.
- **Image Retrieval**: Retrieves images processed by the Comfy UI API, converting them into base64 format for easy integration into client applications.

## Getting Started
To begin using the Comfy UI API Proxy, follow the steps below:
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have the necessary system prerequisites installed. These include [list specific software requirements, versions].
2. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [repository directory]
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configuration**: Configure the proxy settings as per your requirements. Modify the `config.json` file to set up API endpoints, authentication details, and other necessary parameters.
4. **Running the Proxy**: Start the proxy server with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the proxy server on the configured port, allowing it to begin handling requests to and from the Comfy UI API.
